SBA 1- Version Control

## Table of Contents
The assigment is to create a main, review and feature branches.Following are the steps. 

* The steps you took to create and manage branches.
  - After creating a repo in github , I had cloned it to local .
  - Before this updated github repo settings to say "main" instead of "master'
  - Initialized the local repo with git init
  - Made sure local and github repo are in sync with the following  commands
  - git remote add origin https://github.com/aswinirkaranth/version-control-simulation-aswini.git
  - git push -u origin main
  - Created and manage branches using the checkout command 
      eg:- git checkout -b [name of branch]
  - Added necessary features in respective feature branches, staged and commited .
* How you handled the merge conflict -
   - Guildline to handle merge conflicts is by comparing the existing version and incoming version.Choosing to keep one, or both of the changes as per requirement.
   - For this particular assignment I choose to keep only the footer because I had added a conflicting code to simulate a merge conflict.
* How the pull request process helped you ensure code quality and collaboration.
  - After I created the review branch I added a paragraph to main and pushed those two branches to github repo so that I can create a pull request.
  - Pull request helps collaborate with other developers and get code reviewed to ensure code quality before merging to production branch.
  - Reviewing and incorporating suggestions with respect to formatting, style guide and code readability are some of the ways to ensure code quality.
